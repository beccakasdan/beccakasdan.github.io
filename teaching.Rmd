My goal as a teacher is to inspire each of my students to become their own teacher by developing as creative and thoughtful musicians. I believe that communicating with students in a kind and respectful manner is of the utmost importance to foster a love of learning and performing and to instill life-long practice skills. I urge my students to constantly be creative in their approach to practicing and music-making by offering a variety of ways to practice technical passages and encourage students to decide their own musical phrasing and characters within a piece. I also emphasize freedom and physical relaxation in playing and enjoy problem solving alongside students to ensure ease and comfort when playing.
I particularly look forward to studio lessons because they offer a unique experience of really understanding a student’s goals, personality, and learning style. I cultivate a meaningful relationship with each student ensuring that they feel safe, valued, and inspired. I take the time to set up personal meetings with my students before they begin their studies and discuss their learning objectives and musical interests. Together we collaborate on choosing repertoire that interests and excites them. As a result, I teach a wide variety of genres, composers from underrepresented backgrounds, and I am constantly learning new works alongside my students which I enjoy immensely. 
Beyond studio lessons, I am constantly creating and finding opportunities for my students to perform and explore multi-faceted careers as emerging artists. I encourage my students to explore performing opportunities in the community, as I believe that performing frequently is a critical part to musical advancement. Furthermore, I strongly believe that if you can convey the characters, emotions, and technique in an engaging performance to audiences not familiar with classical music, you have not only fully learned the piece, but you have made a meaningful contribution to the community and perhaps inspired others to share in your musical passion. My unique method of teaching encompasses a thoughtful and diligent approach to musical technique, a high standard of musical excellence, a commitment to community outreach and performance, public speaking preparation, and a collaborative experience that is student-centered and fosters a life-long appreciation and passion for music.
